# Charles Ment Personal Web Page

This project aims to create a personal web page in order to showcase my projects and achievements. To make this project more challenging, I decided to enclose the information inside a fake terminal. This not only makes the problem more difficult, but also makes it more interactive with the user.

### Added Functionality

So far I have added:
  * The terminal window visuals with an input box.
  * Basic functionality for the *ls* command.

### Use of AI
As a starting point, I used some code generated by ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. They were also used in small aspects further along in the project.
